# Zombie Tsunami

This game is a semplified version of the 'Zombie Tsunami' game for mobile devices, yet with some differences like the amount of obstacles, the less presence of graphic elements and its limitated game map.

This project has been realized for the Object-Oriented Programming course of the Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering at University of Bologna, Cesena Campus.

## Setup

- Before starting the application, make sure to have the JDK (version 17 or later) installed; it can be downloaded [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/).

- Start the application by running the ``zombietsunami-all.jar`` file or, alternatively, by executing the command ``./gradlew run`` (on Linux) / ``.\gradlew.bat run`` (on Windows) in the project root directory.

## User guide

The rules for the  game are provided in an apposite section in the game menu of the application.

To jump on the game use the 'space' key on your keyboard, otherwise to pause the game use the 'escape' key. 

Remember: in this version of the game if the zombie's strenght is not enough to breake the obstacles in the map, and you will try to pass over them, you wil immidiatelly lose and the game will shut down.  

Try to successfully arrive at the end of the map, catching all the civilians, without losing and avoiding the bombs and the obstacles (or breaking them).
